# IntruderAlert

The project titled 'Intruder Alert System' aims to design and implement a smart embedded security application that detects motion using a PIR (Passive Infrared) motion sensor and alerts through a buzzer while logging events over UART. The system is based on the STM32 Nucleo-F446RE microcontroller board using FreeRTOS for task scheduling and concurrency.
